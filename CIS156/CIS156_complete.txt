FLLC Enterprise IT — Phase 10: Computer Science Concepts
CIS 156 — Computer Science Concepts | Preston Furulie
Spring 2026 | CompTIA ITF+ Aligned
============================================================

COURSE OVERVIEW
---------------
This phase covers foundational computer science concepts aligned
with the CompTIA IT Fundamentals+ (ITF+) certification exam.
Every module is designed as a standalone Python program that
teaches theory through working code demonstrations.

ENTERPRISE APPLICATION NOTES
============================================================

These modules integrate directly into the FLLC Enterprise IT
infrastructure initiative:

Computational Thinking
  Applied when designing automation workflows, troubleshooting
  procedures, and system integration architectures. The ATM
  state machine pattern mirrors real state management in FLLC
  service applications.

Operating Systems
  Process scheduling and memory management knowledge supports
  FLLC server administration, container orchestration (Docker),
  and workstation deployment. Thread vs process understanding
  guides decisions in concurrent application design.

Networking
  OSI model fluency and TCP/IP stack knowledge map directly to
  FLLC network topology, firewall configuration, and inter-
  service communication. Socket programming skills enable
  custom monitoring and integration tools.

Security
  CIA triad principles form the baseline security posture for
  every FLLC system. Password policies, encryption standards,
  and firewall rules demonstrated here reflect actual FLLC
  security controls. Threat awareness training reduces the
  organization's attack surface.

Databases
  SQL and relational design skills support FLLC's inventory
  tracking, user management, and reporting systems. The SQLite
  demonstrations translate directly to production PostgreSQL
  and MySQL environments used across the enterprise.
