# Hardware & Software Fundamentals

## Computer Architecture Overview

Modern computers follow the **Von Neumann architecture**, consisting of five key components:

- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** — executes instructions via the ALU and control unit
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)** — volatile storage for active processes
- **Storage (SSD/HDD)** — persistent data storage
- **I/O Devices** — keyboards, monitors, network interfaces
- **System Bus** — data highway connecting all components

## Software Layers

- **Firmware/BIOS** — initializes hardware on boot
- **Operating System** — manages resources (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- **Applications** — user-facing software (browsers, IDEs, databases)

## Key Metrics

- CPU speed measured in GHz (billions of cycles/second)
- RAM measured in GB (typical: 8-64GB for workstations)
- Storage latency: SSD ~0.1ms vs HDD ~10ms
