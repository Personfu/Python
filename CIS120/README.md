# Phase 01 — IT Foundations
**Department:** Infrastructure | **Course:** CIS 120 — Intro to Computing | **Status:** Complete

---

## Purpose

Establish the theoretical foundation for all enterprise IT systems — understanding how computers represent data, process instructions, and evaluate algorithmic efficiency. These concepts directly inform decisions in every subsequent phase.

## Deliverables

| File | Description | Key Concepts |
|------|------------|-------------|
| [`binary_number_systems.py`](binary_number_systems.py) | Interactive number system converter and bitwise operations toolkit | Base conversion (2/8/10/16), manual algorithms, two's complement, ASCII encoding, bitwise AND/OR/XOR, storage calculations |
| [`hardware_software_fundamentals.md`](hardware_software_fundamentals.md) | Enterprise computing reference document | Von Neumann architecture, CPU fetch-decode-execute cycle, memory hierarchy (L1→tape), bus architecture, OS layers, logic gates, De Morgan's laws |
| [`intro_to_algorithms.md`](intro_to_algorithms.md) | Algorithm theory and complexity analysis guide | Pseudocode conventions, linear/binary search, 4 sorting algorithms, Big-O notation table (O(1) to O(n!)), flowchart symbols, recursion vs iteration |

## Enterprise Application

- **Phase 05** uses Big-O analysis from this phase to evaluate algorithm efficiency
- **Phase 07** builds on binary/bitwise operations for encryption and hashing
- **Phase 08** applies hardware concepts to AWS instance sizing and capacity planning
