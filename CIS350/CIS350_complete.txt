FLLC Enterprise IT — Phase 07: Information Security
CIS 350 — Network & Cybersecurity | Preston Furulie
============================================================

PHASE SUMMARY
─────────────
Four deliverables establishing FLLC's complete cybersecurity
posture: encryption primitives, enterprise network design,
vulnerability management, and firewall policy. These controls
protect all assets across every phase.

============================================================
Deliverable 1: Encryption & Hashing Toolkit
File: encryption_hashing.py (300+ lines)
============================================================

9 Sections:
  1. Hash Function Comparison
     - MD5 (128-bit), SHA-1 (160), SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512
     - Avalanche effect demonstration (1 char change → 50%+ hash change)

  2. Salted Password Hashing
     - secrets.token_hex(16) for 128-bit random salt
     - SHA-256 hashing with salt prepend
     - Same password + different salt = different hash
     - hmac.compare_digest() for timing-safe verification

  3. PBKDF2 Key Derivation
     - hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac("sha256", password, salt, 600000)
     - NIST-recommended 600,000 iterations
     - 256-bit derived key output

  4. HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication)
     - hmac.new() with shared secret key
     - Message integrity AND authenticity verification
     - Tampered message detection demonstration

  5. Password Strength Analyzer
     - Length scoring (8/12/16+ characters)
     - Character diversity (lower/upper/digit/special)
     - Common password detection
     - Entropy estimation (bits of randomness)
     - Strength labels: VERY WEAK → WEAK → MODERATE → STRONG

  6. Caesar Cipher
     - Encryption with configurable shift
     - Decryption (negative shift)
     - Brute-force attack (try all 26 shifts)

  7. XOR Encryption
     - Bitwise XOR with repeating key
     - Self-inverse property: A ⊕ B ⊕ B = A
     - Hex output for binary data display

  8. File Integrity Checking
     - SHA-256 file checksum calculation
     - Tamper detection (before/after comparison)
     - Chunked reading for large files (8192-byte blocks)

  9. Secure Random Generation
     - secrets.token_hex(), token_urlsafe()
     - secrets.randbelow() for bounded integers
     - Cryptographically secure password generator

============================================================
Deliverable 2: Network Topology Design
File: network_topology.md (165+ lines)
============================================================

Sections:
  1. Network Overview
     - Hub-and-spoke with DMZ segmentation
     - 8 VLANs with addressing scheme
     - ASCII logical network diagram

  2. Core Equipment Specifications
     - Palo Alto PA-850 (firewall)
     - Cisco Catalyst 9300 (core switch stack)
     - Cisco Meraki MR46 (Wi-Fi 6 APs)
     - 5 servers with full specs

  3. Security Zones (6 trust levels)
     - Outside (0) → DMZ (25) → Guest (30) → Corporate (70)
       → Servers (80) → Management (90)
     - Inter-zone policy matrix (10 zone pairs)

  4. Wireless Design
     - 3 SSIDs: CORP-SECURE, CORP-VOIP, GUEST-WIFI
     - WPA3-Enterprise for corporate
     - Channel planning and band steering

  5. Redundancy & High Availability
     - Dual ISP with BGP failover (< 30s)
     - VSS switch stack (sub-second failover)
     - Dual PSU + UPS + Generator

  6. Monitoring & Management Stack
     - PRTG, Panorama, Meraki Dashboard, Graylog, Nessus

Deliverable 3: Vulnerability Assessment Report
File: vulnerability_assessment.md (170+ lines)
============================================================

Sections:
  1. Executive Summary
     - 60 total findings: 3 Critical, 8 High, 18 Medium
     - Overall risk rating: HIGH

  2. Scan Configuration
     - Nessus Professional 10.x

============================================================
Deliverable 4: Firewall Configuration
File: firewall_rules.conf (210+ lines)
============================================================

Configuration:
  - Palo Alto Networks zone-based firewall
  - 8 security zone definitions
  - 10 explicit rules + implicit deny-all:
    Rule 1: Outside → DMZ (HTTP/HTTPS)
    Rule 2: DMZ → Servers (MySQL/Redis)
    Rule 3: Servers → Servers (internal API)
    Rule 4: Corporate → Outside (web, filtered)
    Rule 5: Corporate → Servers (SSH, RDP, DB)
    Rule 6: Management → All (full admin)
    Rule 7: Guest → Outside (web only, no internal)
    Rule 8: VoIP traffic (QoS marking)
    Rule 9: IoT → Servers (API only, no internet)
