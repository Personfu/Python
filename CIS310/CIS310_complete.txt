Assignment 1: Software Requirements Specification
------------------------------------------------------------
File: requirements_document.md

Project: Guitar Shop Inventory Tracker (v1.0)

Functional Requirements:
  FR-01: Track product quantities in real-time
  FR-02: Generate low-stock alerts when below threshold
  FR-03: Add, update, and remove products (CRUD)
  FR-04: Generate monthly inventory reports (PDF/CSV)
  FR-05: Support barcode scanning for stock intake

Non-Functional Requirements:
  NFR-01: Page load time under 2 seconds (95th percentile)
  NFR-02: System availability 99.9% uptime
  NFR-03: Support 50+ concurrent users
  NFR-04: Data encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3)

User Roles:
  Admin — Full CRUD, user management, reports
  Manager — Read/write inventory, view reports
  Staff — Read-only, submit stock intake requests

Assignment 2: Use Case Diagrams
------------------------------------------------------------
File: use_cases.md

Use Case: Process Stock Intake
  Actor: Warehouse Staff
  Precondition: Authenticated and on intake screen
  Main Flow:
    1. Staff scans shipment barcode
    2. System displays expected items from PO
    3. Staff verifies and counts items
    4. Staff confirms quantities
    5. System updates inventory
    6. System logs intake with timestamp and staff ID
  Alternative: Quantity mismatch flags discrepancy, notifies manager

Use Case: Generate Report
  Actor: Manager
  Flow: Select date range, report type, format → system generates download


------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment 3: System Architecture Proposal
------------------------------------------------------------
File: system_architecture.md

Architecture: Three-Tier Design

Presentation Layer:
  - React.js SPA, deployed on CDN, JWT authentication

Application Layer:
  - Node.js + Express REST API
  - Input validation, rate limiting (100 req/min)
  - Deployed on AWS ECS with auto-scaling

Data Layer:
  - MySQL 8.0 on AWS RDS (Multi-AZ)
  - Redis cache for sessions and hot queries
  - Daily backups with 30-day retention

Security:
  - HTTPS/TLS 1.3 everywhere
  - OWASP Top 10 mitigations
  - RBAC and parameterized queries
