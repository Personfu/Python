FLLC Enterprise IT — Phase 06: Systems Analysis & PM
CIS 310 — Systems Analysis & Design | Preston Furulie
============================================================

PHASE SUMMARY
─────────────
Three formal systems engineering documents that serve as the
blueprint for the FLLC enterprise platform. Requirements,
use cases, and architecture design directly inform the
implementation in Phases 08 and 09.

============================================================
Deliverable 1: Software Requirements Specification
File: requirements_document.md (160+ lines)
============================================================

Sections:
  1. Document Control (version, author, approval)
  2. Introduction (purpose, scope, stakeholders, definitions)
  3. Overall System Description (context, assumptions, constraints)
  4. Functional Requirements (MoSCoW priority):
     - Product Management (5 requirements)
     - Inventory Management (4 requirements)
     - Purchase Orders (3 requirements)
     - Reporting (3 requirements)
     - User Management (3 requirements)
  5. Non-Functional Requirements:
     - Performance (response time, concurrent users, throughput)
     - Availability (99.9% uptime, RPO, RTO)
     - Security (RBAC, encryption, audit logging)
     - Scalability (horizontal, caching, CDN)
     - Usability (responsive, accessibility, latency)
  6. RBAC Permissions Matrix (4 roles × 8 permission areas)
  7. Acceptance Criteria (quantified success metrics)

============================================================
Deliverable 2: Use Case Documentation
File: use_cases.md (160+ lines)
============================================================

6 Use Cases:
  UC-01: Process Stock Intake
    - Actor: Warehouse Staff
    - Main flow (5 steps), alternative flow (2), exception (2)
    - Business rules: barcode validation, auto-reorder

  UC-02: Generate Report
    - Actor: Store Manager
    - Date range selection, format options (PDF/CSV/screen)

  UC-03: Manage Product Catalog
    - Actor: Manager / Admin
    - CRUD operations with validation rules

  UC-04: Create Purchase Order
    - Actor: Manager
    - Auto-generation from low-stock alerts

  UC-05: User Authentication
    - Actor: Any User
    - Login flow with lockout after 5 failures

  UC-06: Search Inventory
    - Actor: Any Authenticated User
    - Full-text search with filters and sorting

============================================================
Deliverable 3: System Architecture Design
File: system_architecture.md (200+ lines)
============================================================

Sections:
  1. Architecture Overview
     - Three-tier: Presentation → Application → Data
     - ASCII architecture diagram
     - Design principles table

  2. Technology Stack
     - Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
     - Backend: Node.js 20, Express.js, Prisma ORM
     - Database: MySQL 8.0, Redis 7

  3. API Design
     - RESTful endpoints table (12 routes)
     - Middleware pipeline: rate limit → CORS → auth → validate → route
     - Response format standardization

  4. Caching Strategy (5 layers)
     - CDN (static), browser, API response, database query, session

  5. Database Architecture
     - Primary-replica topology
     - Backup strategy: continuous + daily snapshots
     - Connection pooling

  6. Security Architecture (7 layers)
     - Edge → Transport → Network → App → Data → Secrets → Audit

  7. Monitoring & Observability
  8. Scaling Plan (horizontal + vertical)
  9. Environment Strategy (local → staging → production)

Enterprise Application:
  SRS requirements → API endpoints in Phase 09
  Architecture → Terraform infrastructure in Phase 08
  Use cases → integration test scenarios
