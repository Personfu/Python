FLLC Enterprise IT — Phase 09: Enterprise Platform (Capstone)
CIS 425 — Capstone Project | Preston Furulie
============================================================

PHASE SUMMARY
─────────────
The capstone integrates all 8 prior phases into a production-
ready enterprise platform. Six deliverables cover the complete
project lifecycle: proposal → schema → API → documentation →
deployment → presentation.

============================================================
Deliverable 1: Capstone Project Proposal
File: capstone_proposal.md (175+ lines)
============================================================

Sections:
  1. Project Overview (title, student, duration)
  2. Problem Statement (spreadsheet-based inventory → $15K/yr losses)
  3. Proposed Solution (6 core features + 4 differentiators)
  4. Technology Stack (9 technologies with justifications)
  5. System Architecture (ASCII diagram: CDN → ALB → ECS → RDS)
  6. Database Design (10 tables with row estimates)
  7. Project Timeline (16 weeks, 8 phases)
  8. Risk Assessment (5 risks with probability/impact/mitigation)
  9. Success Criteria (8 measurable KPIs)
  10. Skills Demonstrated (integration matrix: CIS 120-410)

============================================================
Deliverable 2: Production Database Schema
File: schema.sql (280+ lines)
============================================================

10 Normalized Tables (3NF):
  - categories (self-referencing parent_id for hierarchy)
  - suppliers (company info, contact, rating)
  - products (full-text index on name+description)
  - customers (email unique, shipping/billing address FKs)
  - addresses (multi-address per customer)
  - orders (ENUM status: pending/shipped/delivered/cancelled)
  - order_items (price snapshot at time of order)
  - reviews (unique constraint: one review per customer+product)
  - inventory_log (append-only audit trail)
  - users (RBAC: admin/manager/staff/viewer, SHA2 password)

Features:
  - 12+ indexes for query performance
  - Foreign keys with ON DELETE CASCADE/RESTRICT/SET NULL
  - CHECK constraints (price > 0, rating 1-5, percent 0-100)
  - 2 reporting views: v_product_catalog, v_order_summary
  - Seed data for all tables

============================================================
Deliverable 3: REST API Server
File: api_server.py (340+ lines)
============================================================

Implementation:
  - Python http.server (no external dependencies)
  - DataStore class (in-memory database simulation)
  - APIHandler with URL routing

15 Endpoints:
  - GET  /api/health — system health check
  - GET  /api/stats — system statistics (admin only)
  - GET  /api/products — list with filter/sort/paginate
  - GET  /api/products/:id — single product detail
  - POST /api/products — create product (auth required)
  - PUT  /api/products/:id — update product (auth required)
  - DELETE /api/products/:id — soft-delete (admin only)
  - GET  /api/categories — list all categories
  - POST /api/auth/login — authenticate, return token
  - GET  /api/inventory — stock levels
  - POST /api/inventory/intake — log stock receipt
  - GET  /api/orders — list orders
  - POST /api/orders — place new order
  - GET  /api/reports/low-stock — below reorder threshold
  - GET  /api/reports/sales — revenue by date range

Features:
  - JWT-style token authentication
  - CORS headers for browser access
  - Query parameter parsing (page, limit, sort, filter)
  - Input validation with descriptive error messages
  - Proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)

============================================================
Deliverable 4: API Documentation
File: api_documentation.md (300+ lines)
============================================================

Sections:
  1. Authentication (login, refresh, token usage)
  2. Products (5 endpoints with full request/response examples)
  3. Inventory (4 endpoints with stock management examples)
  4. Orders (4 endpoints with order lifecycle)
  5. Reports (3 endpoints with format options)
  6. Health & System (2 endpoints)
  7. Error Response Format (standard JSON structure)
  8. HTTP Status Code Reference (10 codes with descriptions)
  9. RBAC Permission Matrix (4 roles × 12 endpoints)

============================================================
Deliverable 5: Deployment Architecture
File: deployment_architecture.md (250+ lines)
============================================================

Sections:
  1. Production Environment Overview
  2. AWS Service Inventory (13 services with cost estimates: ~$176/mo)
  3. Network Architecture (VPC diagram, traffic flow, latency table)
  4. CI/CD Pipeline (7 stages with timing: ~13 min total)
  5. Container Architecture (3-stage Docker, ECS task definition)
  6. Monitoring & Alerting (CloudWatch dashboards, alarm actions)
  7. Scaling Strategy (horizontal auto-scaling rules)
  8. Disaster Recovery (RPO: 15 min, RTO: 1 hour)
  9. Security Controls (8 layers)
  10. Environment Comparison (local vs staging vs production)

============================================================
Deliverable 6: Final Presentation
File: final_presentation.md (170+ lines)
============================================================

14-Slide Deck:
  Slide 1:  Title slide
