Assignment 1: Project Proposal
------------------------------------------------------------
File: capstone_proposal.md

Problem: Small-to-medium music retailers lack affordable, integrated
solutions for inventory, orders, and sales analytics.

Solution: Full-stack web app with:
  - Real-time inventory management
  - Customer-facing e-commerce storefront
  - Admin dashboard with analytics
  - RESTful API for mobile and web

Technology Stack:
  Frontend: React 18, TailwindCSS
  Backend: Node.js, Express
  Database: MySQL 8.0, Redis
  Infrastructure: AWS (ECS, RDS, ALB, CloudFront)
  CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Docker

Timeline: 12-week development cycle
  Weeks 1-2: Requirements, database design
  Weeks 3-5: Backend API development
  Weeks 6-8: Frontend development
  Weeks 9-10: Cloud deployment, CI/CD
  Week 11: Load testing, security audit
  Week 12: Final presentation


------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment 2: Production Database Schema
------------------------------------------------------------
File: schema.sql

6 core tables (normalized to 3NF):
  categories — product categorization
  products — inventory items with pricing and stock
  customers — user accounts with hashed passwords
  addresses — customer shipping/billing addresses (1:M)
  orders — order headers with status tracking
  order_items — line items with quantity and pricing

Key features:
  - AUTO_INCREMENT primary keys on all tables
  - CHECK constraints for price >= 0, discount 0-100, quantity > 0
  - FOREIGN KEY with ON DELETE CASCADE where appropriate
  - Performance indexes on FK columns and order_date


------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment 3: REST API Documentation
------------------------------------------------------------
File: api_documentation.md

Base URL: https://api.example.com/v1

Authentication: JWT access + refresh tokens
  POST /auth/login, POST /auth/refresh

Products API: Full CRUD with pagination, filtering, search
  GET /products (paginated, filterable by category)
  GET /products/:id
  POST /products (Admin/Manager)
  PUT /products/:id (Admin/Manager)
  DELETE /products/:id (Admin, soft-delete)

Inventory API: Stock tracking and adjustments
  GET /inventory, POST /inventory/intake, POST /inventory/adjust

Orders API: Order lifecycle management
  GET /orders, POST /orders, PUT /orders/:id/ship

Reports API: Business intelligence
  GET /reports/inventory, /reports/sales, /reports/low-stock


------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment 4: Deployment Architecture
------------------------------------------------------------
File: deployment_architecture.md

AWS Production Environment:
  Frontend: React SPA on CDN (auto-deploy from main)
  API: Node.js on ECS Fargate (auto-scaling 2-8 tasks)
  Database: RDS MySQL 8.0 Multi-AZ (db.t3.medium, 50GB)
  Cache: ElastiCache Redis (cache.t3.micro)
  Storage: S3 for uploads and reports

CI/CD: Push → Test → Build → Scan → Deploy (zero-downtime)

Monitoring:
  CloudWatch metrics + alarms
  Centralized logging (90-day retention)
  External uptime monitoring (60s intervals)

Disaster Recovery:
  RPO: 1 hour | RTO: 15 minutes
  Multi-AZ RDS failover
  S3 cross-region replication
  Terraform enables full rebuild


------------------------------------------------------------
Final Presentation Summary
------------------------------------------------------------
File: final_presentation.md

Key Metrics:
  API Response Time: < 50ms (p95)
  Page Load: < 1.2s (Lighthouse 95+)
  Test Coverage: 87%
  Uptime: 99.95% over 30 days

Lessons Learned:
  - IaC (Terraform) reduces deployment errors
  - Database indexing improved reporting queries by 10x
  - Docker multi-stage builds: 1.2GB → 180MB image size
  - Implement RBAC early to avoid security retrofitting
